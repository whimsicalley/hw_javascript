# JavaScript Homework
*Advanced Web 2 - Summer 2016*

This homework's original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/richardkalehoff/UF-starter-project).

## Resources

1. Class lecture's canvas pages. Looked primarily at examples for guidance.
    - [Functions](https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/327934/pages/identifiers-and-functions?module_item_id=6150192)
        - probably spent entirely too much time staring at this page trying to figure out the solution to 6C...

    - [Arrays](https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/327934/pages/arrays-and-objects?module_item_id=6150187)

    - [Control Structures](https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/327934/pages/control-structures-and-loops?module_item_id=6150196)

2. [W3Schools.com article](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_array.asp)

    - Used to examine the different ways to use an array. In this case, I was looking for a way to add another string that made more sense than what I did originally.. discovered "push."

## Comments

No lie... 6C took me four days to accomplish. Starting to think you enjoy inflicting pain and suffering on your students. :)
